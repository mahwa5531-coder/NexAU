"""HistoryEvent discriminated union — RFC-0026 forward-compat write channel.

Single typed slot on ``HookResult.history_event`` lets middleware emit any
history-affecting intent (REPLACE today; APPEND / UNDO / future) without
needing to add a new top-level field per event type. Adding a new event
type means adding one variant to the union — old SDK readers fall through
to ``UnknownEvent`` instead of breaking.

Each variant follows the protobuf-philosophy schema (RFC-0022):
``model_config = ConfigDict(extra='allow')`` + all secondary fields
optional, so a new SDK can add fields without breaking old SDK readers.

## Relationship to ``AgentRunActionModel`` (RFC-0022)

These event classes are the **middleware-facing intent envelope**;
``AgentRunActionModel`` (in ``nexau/archs/session/models/agent_run_action_model.py``)
is the **persisted DB row**. They sit at different layers:

  - Event = "I want to emit a REPLACE with these messages and this WHY"
    — no ownership keys, no action_id, no DB columns
  - Action = "row inserted into nexau_agent_run_actions" — has
    user_id / session_id / agent_id / run_id / root_run_id / action_id
    / created_at_ns + the JSONB columns

The typed extra payload (``ReplaceVariantBase`` / ``AppendExtra`` /
``UndoExtra``) is defined ONCE in ``agent_run_action_model.py`` and
shared by both layers — these event classes import them, never
re-declare. The discriminator value (``"replace"`` / ``"append"`` /
``"undo"``) is tied to ``RunActionType.*`` via ``Literal[RunActionType.X]``
so refactoring the enum string keeps both layers consistent.

Flow: middleware emits ``HistoryEvent`` → executor reads
``HookResult.history_event`` → routes to ``ctx.history.replace(...)``
→ ``HistoryList.replace_all`` → ``AgentRunActionService.persist_replace``
→ ``AgentRunActionModel.create_replace`` → DB INSERT.
