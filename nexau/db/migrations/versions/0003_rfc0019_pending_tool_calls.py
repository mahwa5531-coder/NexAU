"""rfc0019 - sessions.pending_tool_calls JSON column

RFC-0019 (PR #481) added a ``pending_tool_calls`` JSON field to
``SessionModel`` so the framework can persist held tool-call decisions
across the user's allow/deny prompt. Fresh DBs pick this up via
``SQLModel.metadata.create_all``, but **legacy DBs whose ``sessions``
table pre-dates #481 silently lack the column** - the SQL hint file
``nexau/archs/session/migrations/001_tool_permission.sql`` only carries
a *comment* about a manual ``ALTER TABLE``; no Python code performs
the ALTER. First call to ``session.pending_tool_calls`` then crashes
with ``OperationalError: no such column``.

This migration closes that gap. Idempotent against fresh DBs (the
column already exists from create_all → no-op).
