"""initial - pre-Phase-1 baseline marker

This is an empty migration that represents the pre-RFC-0022-Phase-1
schema baseline.

History: nexau's session-DB schema was historically bootstrapped via
``SQLModel.metadata.create_all`` (a CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS path that
isn't suited for evolving schemas). RFC-0022 introduced the first schema
change that didn't fit cleanly into that model - adding two columns
(``idempotency_key`` + ``extra``) to ``agent_run_actions`` - and so
nexau adopted alembic for schema evolution from this point forward.

This revision is intentionally a no-op:

- Fresh DB: ``SQLModel.metadata.create_all`` (called from
  ``SQLDatabaseEngine.setup_models``) bootstraps all tables, then
  ``upgrade_to_head`` detects the schema is already at the target state
  and stamps the right baseline.
- Legacy pre-Phase-1 DB: ``upgrade_to_head`` detects via
  ``_detect_baseline_revision`` that ``agent_run_actions`` exists without
  ``idempotency_key`` and stamps this revision (0001) as the starting
  point, then runs 0002 to add the columns.
