"""nexau database migration support (RFC-0022).

Public API for nexau's session-DB schema migration:

-:func:`upgrade_to_head` - apply all pending migrations on a database URL.
  Called automatically from
  ``nexau.archs.session.orm.sql_engine.SQLDatabaseEngine.setup_models``
  unless ``NEXAU_AUTO_MIGRATE=off`` is set in the environment.

-:func:`current_revision` - the alembic revision the database is at.

The migration scripts themselves live under ``nexau/db/migrations/versions/``
and are packaged with the wheel so that ``pip install -U nexau`` is the
only thing a user needs to do - there is no separate ``alembic upgrade``
command for SDK users.
