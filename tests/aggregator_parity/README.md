# Provider Stream Aggregator Parity Tests

> RFC-0023 §Phase ① — first concrete step toward unifying the two parallel provider stream aggregators.

## Why this exists

NexAU currently runs two parallel aggregator implementations on every provider
SSE stream:

- **Set A** — `nexau/archs/llm/llm_aggregators/` — push-style, emits AG-UI
  events for the UI-streaming side
- **Set B** — `nexau/archs/main_sub/execution/llm_caller.py` `*StreamAggregator`
  classes — pull-style, `finalize()` returns a ModelResponse dict for the
  persistence side

Every provider protocol change (Anthropic adds `extended_thinking`, OpenAI
adds reasoning summaries, Gemini adds new part types, …) requires updating
**both** parsers, and any drift between them silently breaks the invariant
that the persisted Message and the SSE-streamed view came from the same
parsing of the same bytes.

This test suite asserts that invariant on a fixed set of synthetic provider
event fixtures, so future refactors (RFC-0023 §Phase ②/③) have a safety net.

## What it does — three equivalence axes

For each fixture, three independent equivalence axes are asserted. All three
must be green before §Phase ③ can retire Set B (see "RFC-0023 §Phase ③ merge
acceptance criteria" in the RFC).

1. **Strong equivalence (Set A vs Set B)** — drive the same provider event
   stream through both aggregators, reduce both outputs to a canonical UMP
   `Message`, and compare role + content blocks (count / order / type /
   primary fields including text content). Failures here = real drift.
   Lives in `test_anthropic_parity.py` / `test_chat_aggregator_parity.py` /
   `test_responses_aggregator_parity.py` / `test_gemini_aggregator_parity.py`.
2. **Weak gaps (Set A vs Set B)** — fields only present in Set B today
   (`usage`, `stop_reason`, `model`, reasoning `signature` / `redacted_data`).
   Recorded — not asserted — because they motivate RFC-0023 §Phase ② event
   extensions. Routed through `ParityReport.weak_gaps` and JUnit XML
   `record_property` for CI dashboards.
3. **Vendor truth (Set A vs vendor non-stream JSON)** — Set A and Set B
   could agree with each other and **both** be wrong relative to the
   vendor's own canonical aggregation. The risk is **prompt cache hit
   rate**: if the aggregated `Message` is replayed back to the vendor on
   the next turn (history compaction, multi-turn tool loops, agent-of-
   agent), its byte shape must match what the vendor itself would have
   produced on a non-stream call — otherwise the cache prefix breaks
   silently. Lives in `test_stream_vs_non_stream.py`. Compares
   **structurally** (block count/order/type + tool name + input top-level
   keys + id format prefix) via `compare_structural`, NOT byte-equal,
   because two independent LLM calls don't produce identical tokens.

`compare_structural`'s teeth are pinned in `test_meta_self.py` against
deliberately-mutated Messages (block count mismatch, tool name mismatch,
input keys mismatch, id prefix mismatch, type mismatch).

## Running

```bash
uv run pytest tests/aggregator_parity/ -v --no-cov
```

Expected output: all strong assertions pass; weak gap recordings appear in
JUnit XML test properties (visible in CI dashboards or via `pytest --junit-xml`).

## Gap report

`gap_report.md` is the human-readable summary across all three axes for
every fixture / recording on disk. It is the input list for RFC-0023
§Phase ②.

Regenerate after adding fixtures, fixing divergences, or registering
new known xfails:

```bash
uv run tests/aggregator_parity/scripts/gen_gap_report.py
```

`test_meta_self.py::test_gap_report_is_fresh` enforces that the
committed file matches the live generator output (timestamp excluded
from the diff). Forgetting to regenerate fails this test in CI.

## Adding a new fixture (Anthropic)

1. Create `tests/aggregator_parity/fixtures/anthropic/<scenario>.py` with a
   `def fixture_<scenario>() -> list[RawMessageStreamEvent]` function returning
   the synthetic event sequence
2. Register it in `tests/aggregator_parity/fixtures/anthropic/__init__.py` by
   appending `("<scenario>", fixture_<scenario>)` to `ANTHROPIC_FIXTURES`
3. The parametrized test picks it up automatically

## Adding a new provider (OpenAI / Gemini / …)

Follow the Anthropic pattern:

1. `<provider>_glue.py` with `run_set_a_<provider>` / `run_set_b_<provider>`
2. `fixtures/<provider>/` with synthetic fixtures
3. `set_b_<provider>_dict_to_message()` helper in `parity_helpers.py`
4. `test_<provider>_parity.py` mirroring `test_anthropic_parity.py`

The reconstructor is provider-agnostic (consumes AG-UI events, not provider
events), so it should not need provider-specific extension as long as the
provider's Set A aggregator emits the standard event types.

## Roadmap

- **Now (this PR)** — Anthropic + OpenAI Chat + OpenAI Responses parity:
  - **Anthropic** — 30 fixtures
    - 3 synthetic SDK + 6 lifted from `test_llm_streaming.py`
    - 3 live recordings from `deepseek-v4-pro-anthropic` (gateway emulator)
    - 5 live recordings from real Claude (`claude-haiku-4-5`,
      `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`) — authentic `signature`
      values on thinking blocks, real-shape parallel `tool_use`
    - **13 round-3 recordings** covering: vision input (image), multi-turn
      with tool result feedback, complex nested tool args, system prompts,
      `stop_sequences`, forced `tool_choice`, variant models
      (`claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-haiku` w/ tool, very short response),
      prefilled assistant turns, `cache_control` blocks, max_tokens
      truncation, long text streaming
  - **OpenAI Chat** — 9 fixtures (all live recordings)
    - 2 from `deepseek-v4-flash` (incremental tool-call deltas)
    - 2 from `gpt-5.4` (whole tool call in one chunk)
    - 1 multi-turn with tool result, 1 vision, 1 DeepSeek thinking
    - 4 live OpenRouter recordings via openrouter.ai/api/v1
      (`gpt-oss-120b`, `glm-4.5-air`, `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni`):
      real wire shape with `delta.reasoning` + `delta.reasoning_details`
      extension fields. (3 prior synthetic list-content lifts removed
      after live recording confirmed OpenRouter doesn't emit list-shape
      `delta.content` — they were obsolete provider-specific shapes.)
  - **Gemini REST** — 8 fixtures (all live recordings)
    - 7 from `gemini-2.5-flash`: plain text, thinking, tool, multi-turn
      thinking-then-tool, vision, system instruction, long text streaming
    - 1 from `gemini-flash-lite-latest` (variant)
  - **OpenAI Responses** — 12 fixtures
    - 1 synthetic SDK + 1 lifted
    - 2 from `gpt-5.2`
    - 2 from `gpt-5.4` (reasoning effort + parallel tools)
    - **6 round-3 recordings**: vision input, multi-turn with tool result,
      `gpt-5.5` variant, `instructions` parameter, max_tokens truncation,
      `reasoning.effort=high` with detailed summary
  - **Total**: 207 parity / meta / synthetic tests passing + 1 xfail
    (Anthropic `rec_server_tool_use` — `web_search` server tool with
    citations_delta + multi-text-block divergence; design discussion
    deferred to RFC-0023 §Phase ②). All other drift divergences captured
    by the harness have been fixed in production code (5 production
    bugs fixed across all 4 providers).
  - **Coverage**: anthropic 91% / openai_chat 87% / openai_responses 88% /
    gemini 95% / events 97% — average ~92% across all aggregators.
- **PR-A.1** — Gemini provider (no public model on the gateway tested) +
  Anthropic `RedactedThinkingBlock` / `server_tool_use` recordings (need a
  reasoning model with redacted thinking enabled)
- **PR-B (RFC-0023 §Phase ②)** — Add `ModelCallFinishedEvent` + extend
  `ThinkingTextMessage*`; once landed, `test_*_weak_gaps_*` will be
  augmented to **assert** each gap is closed (no longer just record)
- **PR-C (RFC-0023 §Phase ③)** — Retire Set B; parity tests degenerate to
  internal consistency tests on the now-single aggregator

### Why no OpenAI Chat fixtures lifted from `test_llm_streaming.py`

The 3 OpenAI Chat fixtures in `test_llm_streaming.py` use the OpenRouter
extension `delta.content: list[{type: output_text, text: ...}]` (a borrowed
Anthropic-style typed-parts shape). Set B's permissive `consume()` accepts
this; Set A's strict `ChatCompletionChunk` Pydantic typing rejects it (which
sets `delta.content: str | None`). These cases live entirely in Set B's
input domain — Set A never sees them in production at all. They represent
a real input-domain divergence to resolve in RFC-0023 §Phase ②/③ but are
not parity-testable in their current form.

The live OpenAI Chat recordings under `fixtures/openai_chat/recordings/`
use canonical OpenAI format and exercise both Sets cleanly.
- **PR-B (RFC-0023 §Phase ②)** — Add `ModelCallFinishedEvent` + extend
  `ThinkingTextMessage*`; once landed, `test_*_weak_gaps_*` will be
  augmented to **assert** each gap is closed (no longer just record)
- **PR-C (RFC-0023 §Phase ③)** — Retire Set B; parity tests degenerate to
  internal consistency tests on the now-single aggregator

## Coverage snapshot (this PR)

Running `uv run pytest tests/aggregator_parity/ --cov=nexau.archs.llm.llm_aggregators`:

| Module | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| `llm_aggregators/anthropic/anthropic_event_aggregator.py` | **78%** |
| `llm_aggregators/openai_chat_completion/...` | **71%** |
| `llm_aggregators/openai_responses/openai_responses_aggregator.py` | **87%** |
| `llm_aggregators/events.py` | 97% |
| `llm_aggregators/gemini_rest/...` | 15% (PR-A.1) |

Combined with existing `tests/unit/test_anthropic_event_aggregator.py`:

- Anthropic Set A coverage rises to **93%**

What's still uncovered after this iteration (deferred to PR-A.1 with real recordings):

- Anthropic: `RedactedThinkingBlock`, `server_tool_use`, `SignatureDelta`,
  cache token surfaces, malformed JSON recovery, mid-stream errors
- OpenAI Responses: refusal, image generation calls, file search, etc.

## Real divergences this harness has surfaced

| Fixture | Divergence | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Anthropic `thinking_delta_without_block_start` | Previously: Set A dropped orphan thinking_delta entirely (logs warning, emits no events). Set B infers block type and produces ReasoningBlock. Real production impact: live SSE wouldn't show the thinking, but persisted history would. | **fixed** in `AnthropicEventAggregator._handle_content_block_delta` — lazy-synthesizes thinking block on first delta, mirroring Set B's behavior |
| Anthropic `rec_single_tool_call` (live recording) | Real gateway emits 8+ duplicate `content_block_start` events for the same tool_use index, each carrying empty `id`/`name`. Set B's `_active_blocks` merge logic preserves the prior id/name. Set A's strict `ToolUseBlock` Pydantic rejects empty values. **Confirms the production reality of the `duplicate_starts` synthetic test in `test_llm_streaming.py`**. Worked around in `anthropic_glue._coerce_to_sdk_events` (stateful prior-state preservation) for parity testability; underlying fix is for §Phase ② to standardize behavior. | passing (with normalizer workaround) |
| Anthropic recordings missing terminal `content_block_stop` / `message_stop` (max_tokens truncation) | Set B's `_flush_active_blocks` at finalize() handles this; Set A's events stop emitting prematurely → reconstructor would lose the unclosed block. Mirrored Set B's flush-at-finalize in the reconstructor itself. | passing (with reconstructor workaround) |
| OpenAI Responses `rec_gpt5_tool_with_reasoning` + `rec_gpt5_high_reasoning` | Previously: gpt-5.x produced reasoning silently (`item.summary=[]`, no follow-up `reasoning_summary_*` events). Set B persisted an empty ReasoningBlock; Set A emitted no thinking events. Confirmed reproducible at every effort level (`medium` AND `high` + `summary=detailed`). | **fixed** in `_ReasoningItemAggregator` — emits `ThinkingTextMessageStart` on initial `output_item.added` reasoning dispatch (idempotent with `summary_part.added` Start emission), and emits `ThinkingTextMessageEnd` from `finish()` (called by parent on `output_item.done`). Silent reasoning now produces a Start+End pair (empty content) matching Set B's empty-block marker. |
| Gemini `rec_thinking_then_tool` | Wire emits reasoning chunk → tool chunk in order. Set A kept the thinking block "open" while emitting tool Start+Args+End, then closed thinking at finishReason. Reconstructor produced `[ToolUseBlock, ReasoningBlock]` (close-event order) instead of `[ReasoningBlock, ToolUseBlock]` (wire order). | **fixed** in `GeminiRestEventAggregator._handle_text_part` and `_handle_function_call_part` — now call `_close_thinking_if_open()` before emitting tool/text events when transitioning from thinking, ensuring downstream block ordering matches wire order. |
| OpenAI Chat OpenRouter `delta.content: list` (synthetic lifts) | Synthetic fixtures lifted from `test_llm_streaming.py`. Set A's strict ChatCompletionChunk rejects list-shape; Set B's permissive consume accepts. | **removed** — live OpenRouter API confirmed via PR-A.0 recordings does NOT emit list-shape `delta.content`. These were obsolete provider shapes. |
| OpenAI Responses `summary_part.added` shortcut (rewrote in lift) | If reasoning's initial `output_item.added.item.summary` is pre-populated and `summary_part.added` is skipped, Set A drops reasoning entirely. Set B builds the ReasoningBlock anyway. Rewrote the lifted fixture to canonical wire format. | resolved by fixture rewrite |

Future recordings (especially real `RedactedThinking` / `server_tool_use` /
`SignatureDelta` cases) are likely to surface more. The xfail mechanism keeps
them visible without blocking CI.

## Cross-validation: the 3 captured divergences are industry-wide

After fixing the 3 production divergences (Anthropic orphan thinking_delta,
OpenAI Responses silent reasoning, OpenAI Chat OpenRouter reasoning fields),
a search of OSS confirms each one is a **known wire-format pathology**
that other frameworks have hit and fixed independently. Documenting here so
later RFC-0023 §Phase ② design work has the prior-art context:

### 1. Reasoning field naming chaos (`reasoning_content` vs `reasoning` vs `reasoning_details`)

- **vLLM RFC-27755** ([Oct 2025](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/27755)):
  vLLM originally followed DeepSeek (`reasoning_content`); GPT-OSS
  guidance recommended `reasoning`; vLLM renamed in PR-27752, kept
  `reasoning_content` for backwards compat. **Same wire-format split**
  we observed across OpenRouter (`reasoning_details` structured) /
  DeepSeek (`reasoning_content` flat) / GPT-OSS (`reasoning` flat).
- **nexau Set A** `OpenAIChatCompletionAggregator._extract_reasoning_delta`
  already pulls from BOTH `reasoning_content` and `reasoning_details`
  — confirmed correct architectural choice. Our parity harness fix
  was just teaching the Set B converter to pull from the same
  fields (test infrastructure, not production code).

### 2. OpenAI Responses silent reasoning summary

- **OpenAI Developer Community** [Jul 2025](https://community.openai.com/t/o3-model-in-api-often-omits-reasoning-summary-despite-reasoning-summary-detailed/1307301):
  o3 omits reasoning summary >90% of cases despite explicit
  `reasoning.summary: detailed`.
- **JetBrains/koog #1264** ([2025](https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/issues/1264)):
  identical pattern — `OpenAILLMClient.executeResponsesStreaming` was
  ignoring `ResponseReasoningSummaryTextDelta` events; reasoning
  summaries weren't streamed incrementally, only available in the
  final `ResponseCompleted` event.
- **Our fix** (Set A emits `ThinkingTextMessage{Start,End}` on
  `output_item.added` reasoning dispatch + `finish()` from
  `output_item.done`) ensures consistent SSE events even when OpenAI
  silently produces no summary text. Aligns with what Koog and others
  had to do.

### 3. Anthropic streaming aggregator bugs (orphan thinking_delta, dropped tool_use input)

- **Spring AI #4407** ([Sep 2025](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/issues/4407)):
  "Anthropic Thinking Content Missing in Streaming Responses for
  Sonnet/Opus 4 model" — same class of bug as our orphan
  thinking_delta: streaming aggregator wasn't handling thinking
  deltas correctly under specific conditions.
- **LiteLLM #25321** ([Apr 2026](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/25321)):
  `/v1/messages` streaming adapter dropped `tool_use` input arguments
  during translation. Same root cause class — content_block_start
  event handling not properly queueing companion deltas.
- **Our fix** (lazy thinking_id synthesis on orphan thinking_delta in
  `AnthropicEventAggregator._handle_content_block_delta`) mirrors
  Set B's permissive behavior and matches the pattern that LiteLLM /
  Spring AI / Koog all had to converge on independently.

**Takeaway**: nexau's parity harness independently rediscovered three
issues that the wider OSS community has been fighting for the past year+.
The fixes we shipped are aligned with industry consensus. The remaining
6 xfails (synthetic `delta.content: list` lifts) likely represent an
obsolete provider routing — live OpenRouter API doesn't emit that shape.

## Adding a new recording (reproducible)

Use ``scripts/record_fixture.py``:

```bash
export NEXAU_PARITY_BASE_URL="https://your-gateway.example.com"
export NEXAU_PARITY_API_KEY="sk-..."  # never gets written to any file

uv run tests/aggregator_parity/scripts/record_fixture.py \
    --provider anthropic \
    --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 \
    --scenario my_new_scenario \
    --prompt "Briefly describe Beijing weather"
```

The script:
1. Composes the right request shape per provider
2. Streams SSE to ``fixtures/<provider>/recordings/<scenario>.sse``
3. Validates the recording isn't an error response
4. Redacts ``safety_identifier`` / ``prompt_cache_key`` and any leaked key
5. Prints next steps (register fixture, run parity)

API keys are read from env var only — never written to any file.

### Recording the vendor-truth pair (axis 3)

Add ``--also-non-stream`` to the same command. The script makes a second
call with the same prompt and ``stream:false`` (or for Gemini: switches
the URL path from ``streamGenerateContent`` to ``generateContent``) and
saves the JSON response to ``<scenario>.non_stream.json`` next to the
``.sse`` file. ``test_stream_vs_non_stream.py`` auto-discovers any
`<scenario>.sse` + `<scenario>.non_stream.json` pair on disk and runs
the structural comparison.

```bash
uv run tests/aggregator_parity/scripts/record_fixture.py \
    --provider anthropic \
    --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 \
    --scenario my_new_scenario \
    --prompt "Briefly describe Beijing weather" \
    --also-non-stream
```

Real divergences uncovered this way (i.e. provider designs the two paths
differently and we can't change it) get registered in
``KNOWN_VENDOR_TRUTH_DIVERGENCES`` in `test_stream_vs_non_stream.py`
with a written rationale and `strict=True` xfail.

## How recordings were captured (historical)

The first 26 live recordings were captured by hand-rolled curl from the
`northgate.xiaobei.top` gateway (before ``record_fixture.py`` existed).
Three batches were used:

1. **First batch** (gateway emulator models — `deepseek-v4-pro-anthropic`,
   `deepseek-v4-flash`, `gpt-5.2`): exercises wire-format pathology like
   the duplicate `content_block_start` issue.
2. **Second batch** (authentic provider models — `claude-haiku-4-5`,
   `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-5.4`): exercises real
   provider-side behavior including authentic `signature` values on
   thinking blocks, real `parallel_tool_calls`, and the silent-reasoning
   divergence on gpt-5 series.

```bash
# Anthropic-compatible
curl -sN "$BASE/v1/messages" \
  -H "x-api-key: $KEY" -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4-pro-anthropic","messages":[...],"max_tokens":N,"stream":true}' \
  > fixtures/anthropic/recordings/<scenario>.sse

# OpenAI Chat
curl -sN "$BASE/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4-flash","messages":[...],"tools":[...],"stream":true}' \
  > fixtures/openai_chat/recordings/<scenario>.sse

# OpenAI Responses
curl -sN "$BASE/v1/responses" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-5.2","input":[...],"tools":[...],"stream":true}' \
  > fixtures/openai_responses/recordings/<scenario>.sse
```

**Redaction**: after recording, `safety_identifier` and `prompt_cache_key`
are replaced with sentinel values (`user-redacted` / `redacted-cache-key`).
API keys never appear in recordings (they're in request headers, not
responses). A final scan confirms no key prefix is present in any committed
file.

To add new recordings, follow the same pattern, then run the redaction
sweep before committing (see commit history for the script used).
